# CSE 160 Final Project

Contributers: O. Gencer Ates, Matthew Dolce, Hannah Lee, Felix Quintana


Your final project is a group project.  But the task is something you can define.  As a group, you need to: 

decide on a realistic task (utilizing multiple data science steps we have discussed, such as data collection, data cleansing, classification, clustering, and visualization).  
You may not use data from the UCI Machine Learning repository, and the data you use must have at least 1,000 data points.
decide on a target customer (could be a person, company, or population, but must be someone who would value what you are doing).
post a 2-3 paragraph description of your proposed task, data to be used (how large?), and target customer(s) along with the names of your team members to the appropriate place in Piazza by Wednesday, November 13 (earlier is highly suggested).
confirm (after possible adjustments based on the feedback you receive) your proposed task and customer by Monday, November 18.
perform the proposed task (highly recommended to start early).
produce a one-page executive summary, plus 5-7 page report of technical supporting material, plus one page appendix describing contributions of each team member, due Sunday, December 15.
make a ten-to-eleven minute presentation of your project and your results to the class on Monday, December 16 at 7pm.
